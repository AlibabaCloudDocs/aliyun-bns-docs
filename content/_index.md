# Accelerate Your Development of Web3 Applications

Alibaba Cloud has edge computing nodes around the world. By using this advantage, Alibaba Cloud provides a high-performance, distributed, and decentralized blockchain node service for developers to accelerate the development of Web3 applications.

To process user requests, decentralized applications (DApps) require data from different blockchain networks and must be connected to the blockchains. RPC is an effective way to connect a DApp to a node on a blockchain network.

By using BNS, you no longer need to send requests to your local node. You can call an API operation of BNS to view the information about a blockchain. BNS eliminates the costs of node construction, development, and O&M, and helps you solve the issues related to service unavailability and insufficient scalability.
