# Introduction

BNS (Blockchain Node Service) is a service that provides full-node RPC call capabilities based on
blockchain nodes for all web3 customers. BNS helps customers achieve full node hosting (customers no
longer need to send requests to their own local nodes, but only need to send requests to the provider that
provides the same API - BNS, to access the information on the blockchain), thereby exempting customers
from The cost of node operation and maintenance, time-consuming development, and services are
unavailable/scalable.
